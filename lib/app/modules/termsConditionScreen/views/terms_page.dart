This commitment includes your obligation to ensure that all information provided during registration and use of the platform is truthful, accurate and up to date.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATFORM</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Nelya is a mobile application developed by Apprecano Ltd., designed to provide users with a reliable and private tool for tracking the menstrual cycle and managing their reproductive well- being. The application is available for download through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and has been created with a focus on privacy, allowing it to be used without an Internet connection or cloud storage. All information entered by the user is kept exclusively on their device, with Nelya not collecting, processing or storing personal or health data.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Since Nelya does not require the creation of accounts or the linking of online services, the security and privacy of the information depend entirely on the user's control over their device. The application is designed to be used completely locally, which guarantees that there is no transfer of data to external servers or third parties.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Nelya does not provide medical advice or replace consultation with healthcare professionals. The application is designed for informational purposes and to support personal well-being only, and its use should not be interpreted as a medical diagnosis or treatment. Users are responsible for their use of the information provided by the application and should consult a healthcare professional with any medical concerns.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3. SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Nelya offers users the possibility of accessing premium functionalities through a paid subscription. The subscription is purchased through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store platforms, using the in-app subscription system. By subscribing, the user accepts that payments will be processed securely through the corresponding application store and that billing will be carried out automatically and recurrently using the payment method provided at the time of subscription.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The user authorizes the Apple App Store or Google Play Store to periodically charge the amount corresponding to the subscription until it is canceled. The billing frequency, price and subscription conditions may vary by region and will be clearly specified in the application store at the time of purchase. In the event that payment cannot be processed, the application store may suspend or cancel access to the premium features of the application until successful payment is completed.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the end of each billing period, unless the user cancels the subscription before the renewal date. Subscription cancellation must be done directly through the user's account in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store in the billing and subscriptions section. Cancellation will prevent future charges, but will not grant refunds for the subscription period already paid, and access to premium features will continue to be available until the end of the current billing cycle.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Nelya does not manage or have control over payments, billing or refund requests. Any queries related to billing problems, unrecognized charges or refund requests should be managed directly with the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, in accordance with their terms and conditions.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The company is not responsible for problems arising from payment processing or changes in app store policies.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The user is responsible for managing their subscription and making sure to review the payment and renewal terms before subscribing. The company reserves the right to modify subscription prices and the features included in the premium version at any time. In case of price changes, users will receive a notification through the application store before the next billing date, and they can decide whether to continue with the subscription or cancel it before renewal.</p><p> </p><p><strong>4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Nelya is a mobile application designed for monitoring the menstrual cycle and managing reproductive well-being, developed by Apprecano Ltd. Its use is purely for information and personal support, and should not be interpreted as medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. The company makes no guarantees as to the accuracy, reliability or suitability of the information provided by the application and is not responsible for any consequences arising from its use. Users are advised to consult a healthcare professional before making any decisions based on information entered or generated by the application.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The use of Nelya is the sole responsibility of the user. Given that the application works completely locally on the user's device and does not collect, process or store personal or health data on external servers, the company is not responsible for the loss, damage or inaccessibility of data in the event of device failure, accidental deletion, factory reset, theft or any other circumstance affecting the local storage of information. The company does not provide data recovery mechanisms or backup services either, so the user is solely responsible for backing up their device as they deem necessary.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The company does not guarantee that the application will be free from errors, interruptions or technical faults. Despite efforts to maintain the proper functioning of the application, Apprecano Ltd. is not responsible for direct or indirect damages, loss of data, loss of profit, service interruption or any other consequence derived from the use or inability to use the application, including failures derived from updates, incompatibilities with the operating system or technical problems of the Apple App Store and Google Play Store platforms. Any inconvenience related to the installation, subscription, billing or payment processing should be handled directly with the corresponding application store, as the company does not control or manage the financial transactions made through these platforms.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The user acknowledges and accepts that the use of the application is voluntary and at their own risk. Nelya does not monitor, analyze or transfer data to external servers, which means that the company cannot provide assistance in the recovery of lost information or respond to requests for access, rectification or deletion of data, as this data remains exclusively on the user's device and is not in the company's possession. The company will not be liable for any damage arising from the lack of access to the data in case of forgetting the application's PIN code or any other access restriction imposed by the device's operating system.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">To the extent permitted by applicable law, Apprecano Ltd. disclaims all liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages arising from the use of the</p><p class="ql-align-justify">application, even if it has been advised of the possibility of such damages. If any jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties or liabilities, the liability of the company shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. The user agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the company, its directors, employees, partners and affiliates for any claim, damage or harm arising from the improper use of the application or from the breach of the established terms and conditions.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Apprecano Ltd. reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue any functionality of the application at any time without prior notice, without this giving rise to any right to indemnification or compensation for the user. The user is responsible for periodically verifying the availability and proper functioning of the application on their device, as well as ensuring that they comply with the technical and operating system compatibility requirements.</p><p> </p><p><strong>5.
